Standardized Test Statistics for Large Sample Hypothesis Tests Concerning a Single Population Mean
 If  σ
  is known:  Z=x¯−μ0σ/n√
  
If  σ
  is unknown:  Z=x¯−μ0s/n√
 
The test statistic has the standard normal distribution.

The distribution of the standardized test statistic and the corresponding rejection region for each form of the alternative hypothesis (left-tailed, right-tailed, or two-tailed), is shown in Figure  8.2.1

Example  8.2.1
 
It is hoped that a newly developed pain reliever will more quickly produce perceptible reduction in pain to patients after minor surgeries than a standard pain reliever. The standard pain reliever is known to bring relief in an average of  3.5
  minutes with standard deviation  2.1
  minutes. To test whether the new pain reliever works more quickly than the standard one,  50
  patients with minor surgeries were given the new pain reliever and their times to relief were recorded. The experiment yielded sample mean  x¯=3.1
  minutes and sample standard deviation  s=1.5
  minutes. Is there sufficient evidence in the sample to indicate, at the  5%
  level of significance, that the newly developed pain reliever does deliver perceptible relief more quickly)
