n this section we describe and demonstrate the procedure for conducting a test of hypotheses about the mean of a population in the case that the sample size  n
  is at least  30
 . The Central Limit Theorem states that  X¯¯¯¯
  is approximately normally distributed, and has mean  μX¯¯¯¯¯=μ
  and standard deviation  σX¯¯¯¯¯=σ/n−−√
 , where  μ
  and  σ
  are the mean and the standard deviation of the population. This implies that the statistic

x¯−μσ/n−−√
 
has the standard normal distribution, which means that probabilities related to it are given in Figure 7.1.5 and the last line in Figure 7.1.6.

If we know  σ
  then the statistic in the display is our test statistic. If, as is typically the case, we do not know  σ
 , then we replace it by the sample standard deviation  s
 . Since the sample is large the resulting test statistic still has a distribution that is approximately standard normal.
