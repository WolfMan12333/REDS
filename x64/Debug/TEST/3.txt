Solution
We perform the test of hypotheses using the five-step procedure given at the end of Section 8.1.

Step 1. The natural assumption is that the new drug is no better than the old one, but must be proved to be better. Thus if  Î¼
  denotes the average time until all patients who are given the new drug experience pain relief, the hypothesis test is
H0:Î¼=3.5vsHa:Î¼<3.5@Î±=0.05
Step 2. The sample is large, but the population standard deviation is unknown (the  2.1
  minutes pertains to the old drug, not the new one). Thus the test statistic is
Z=xÂ¯âˆ’Î¼0s/nâˆ’âˆ’âˆš
 
and has the standard normal distribution.
Step 3. Inserting the data into the formula for the test statistic gives
Z=xÂ¯âˆ’Î¼0s/nâˆ’âˆ’âˆš=3.1âˆ’3.51.5/50âˆ’{â¸²ôÁ&d
